CONTENT RULES
- Every question MUST include:
  title, description, prompt, topic, difficulty, estimatedTimeMinutes
- description is the human-readable text shown directly to the user as the question.
- prompt is the text we can feed to an AI model for evaluation. It may repeat the description but can also add instructions for how to evaluate answers.
- aiEvaluationHint:
  - MUST be tailored to this specific question (no generic templates).
  - For open and system-design questions, MUST be a non-empty string that can be used directly as guidance for an AI evaluator. It SHOULD:
    - list the key points or aspects a strong answer should mention,
    - note common mistakes or misconceptions to penalize,
    - describe how to judge partial vs full credit.
  - For other question types it MAY be null.
- Favour entry and junior difficulty; include few middle; rarely senior.
- MCQ questions:
  - MUST appear in mcq_questions.
  - correctAnswerText MUST be a single fully correct (true) answer statement.
  - Additional incorrect options will be generated later based on correctAnswerText.

  - correctAnswer MUST be either true or false (not null).
  - explanation MUST clearly justify the answer.

  - the question description MUST clearly explain the system, the key components, and what the candidate should design or reason about.
  - keep diagrams simple for entry/junior difficulty.
- Positions:
  - positions MUST be an array of plain strings (no objects).
  - use simple role names like "Frontend Engineer", "Backend Engineer", "Full Stack Engineer", "DevOps Engineer".
- Interview types:
  - interviewTypes MUST use only: "regular", "practice", "flash", "play", "competitive", "teacher".
  - for MCQ questions: interviewTypes MUST include only "play".

- Keep questions simple, readable and beginner-friendly.
- Must strictly output valid JSON only, no commentary or markdown.

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Return only JSON, no explanations or markdown, no code fences.
- Use a single JSON object with keys:
  "mcq_questions", "open_questions", "truefalse_questions", "matching_questions", "system_design_questions".
- Do not include trailing commas.
- All string values MUST be double-quoted.
