Load Balancing: Swarm automatically balances service tasks across nodes for optimal resource utilization. Scaling: Services can be scaled up or down to adjust the number of replicas of a given task. Rolling Updates: Swarm supports rolling updates to services, allowing for zero-downtime deployments. Networking: Swarm provides networking features to connect services within the swarm securely.",
