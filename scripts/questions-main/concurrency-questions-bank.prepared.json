Hold and Wait: Processes holding resources are waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they must be released voluntarily. Circular Wait: There exists a circular chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next member in the chain.",

Key aspects: Counter-Based: A semaphore maintains a counter to track the number of available resources or slots. Acquire and Release: Threads or processes must acquire the semaphore before accessing a shared resource and release it after use. Blocking Mechanism: If the semaphore's count is zero (all resources are in use), a thread attempting to acquire it will block until a resource becomes available. Signaling: When a resource is released, the semaphore increments its count, potentially unblocking a waiting thread.",
