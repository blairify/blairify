This makes it easy to adopt incrementally and use with existing JavaScript codebases.\nEarly Error Detection: TypeScript's compiler can detect errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, leading to more robust code and faster debugging.",

They describe the shape of an object or class.\nType Alias: Type aliases are defined using the type keyword. They can represent any type, not just objects, and are more flexible.\nExtending/Implementing:\nInterface: Interfaces can be extended by other interfaces using the extends keyword, and classes can implement interfaces.\nType Alias: Type aliases cannot be extended or implemented. They are standalone and represent specific types.\nCompatibility:\nInterface: Interfaces are open-ended by default. If you declare an interface with a certain structure, you can later add more properties to it without causing issues.\nType Alias: Type aliases create exact types. Once defined, you cannot add or change properties to the type without breaking compatibility.\nUnion and Intersection:\nInterface: Interfaces are not suitable for creating union or intersection types directly.\nType Alias: Type aliases can be used to create union types (|) and intersection types (&) more easily.\nExample:\n\ntypescript\n\nCopy code\n\n// Interface\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n}\n   \n// Extending an interface\ninterface Employee extends Person {\n    employeeId: string;\n}\n \n// Type alias\ntype Person = {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n};\n \n// Creating a union type with a type alias\ntype StringOrNumber = string | number;",

The generated code adheres to the specified ECMAScript version (e.g., ES5, ES6).\nOutput Files: The compiled JavaScript code can be output to one or more JavaScript files, preserving the directory structure of the source code.\nDeclaration Files (Optional): Declaration files (with a .d.ts extension) can also be generated to provide type information for TypeScript consumers of JavaScript libraries.\nModule Resolution: If the code uses modules, the compiler resolves module dependencies and ensures that imported modules are available.\nSource Maps (Optional): Optionally, source maps can be generated to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript source code for debugging.\nTo compile TypeScript code, you typically run the tsc command with the TypeScript source files as arguments.",

Unlike compilation, which typically translates high-level code into machine code or a lower-level language, transpilation converts code from one high-level language to another.\nIn the case of TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript, the TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript code. This transpilation process allows developers to use TypeScript's static typing and additional features while still generating code that can be executed in any JavaScript runtime environment.",
