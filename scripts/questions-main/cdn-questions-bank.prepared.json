Geolocation and Server Selection: The CDN's DNS server determines the user's location and selects the nearest or most suitable edge server in the CDN network. Routing User Requests: The CDN DNS responds with the IP address of the chosen edge server, ensuring the user connects to the optimal server location. Load Balancing: The CDN DNS considers server load and health to evenly distribute traffic and prevent overloading. Improved Performance: By routing users to the closest or best-performing server, DNS reduces latency and speeds up content delivery.

Header Compression: Reduces the size of header data, speeding up data transmission. Server Push: Anticipates resource needs and sends them in advance, reducing load times. Stream Prioritization: Prioritizes critical resources, ensuring they load faster for a better user experience. HTTP/3 QUIC Protocol: Operates over UDP, reducing connection establishment time and improving congestion control. Improved Latency: Especially beneficial in unstable network conditions, enhancing content delivery speed. Enhanced Security: Integrates TLS 1.3 for faster and more secure connections. Connection Migration: Maintains connections even with IP address changes, useful for mobile users.",

DNS Resolution: Directs user requests to the nearest or most optimal edge server for efficient routing. Load Balancers: Evenly distribute user requests among edge servers to prevent overload. Caching Mechanisms: Temporarily store content on edge servers to reduce load on the origin server. Content Replication: Ensures content is duplicated from the origin to edge servers, either actively or passively. Network Layer: Connects edge servers, PoPs, and the origin server, optimizing data routing. Control Layer: Manages content distribution and delivery, including security and analytics.
