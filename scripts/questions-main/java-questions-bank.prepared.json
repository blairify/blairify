Simple Syntax: Easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C and C++, with simpler syntax. Robust and Secure: Strong memory management, garbage collection, exception handling, and a security manager. Multi-threaded: Built-in support for concurrent programming. High Performance: Optimized through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Distributed: APIs for networking and creating distributed applications. Dynamic and Extensible: Supports dynamic loading of classes. Rich Standard Library: Comprehensive APIs for data structures, networking, I/O, and UI design.

Composition is a strong association where the part's lifecycle is managed by the whole. The part cannot exist without the whole, and if the whole is destroyed, so is the part. For example, a house composes rooms; if the house is demolished, the rooms cease to exist.
