It keeps track of the original values of the properties and detects any changes made to these entities. When SaveChanges() is called, the change tracker examines the state of each tracked entity and generates the appropriate SQL commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to persist these changes to the database. Entities can be in various states (Added, Modified, Deleted, Unchanged). Understanding the change tracker is crucial for efficient data manipulation, and disabling it with AsNoTracking() can improve performance for read-only operations.",
