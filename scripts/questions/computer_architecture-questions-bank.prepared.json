Data Hazards: Occur when instructions that are pipelined are waiting for data to be computed or retrieved. They are subdivided into: Read After Write (RAW): A dependency where a subsequent instruction requires data from a previous instruction. Write After Read (WAR): Occurs when an instruction requires a resource that a previous instruction is using to produce a result. Write After Write (WAW): Happens when two instructions that write to the same location are queued concurrently.

In a snooping protocol, each cache controller monitors (or \"snoops\") the data traffic on a shared bus to determine if other caches have copies of a block of memory that it wants to read or write. When a processor writes data, the snooping mechanism checks if that data is stored in another processor's cache and updates or invalidates the corresponding entries, maintaining data consistency across all caches. This protocol is commonly used in bus-based shared memory systems.",

It enables a computer to run larger applications or multiple applications simultaneously without relying solely on physical memory in the system. Virtual memory combines the computer's RAM with temporary space on the hard disk. When RAM runs low, virtual memory moves data to a space called a paging file or swap space, allowing the system's RAM to focus on running applications, thus enhancing the overall efficiency and performance.",

          "text": "Latches are basic electronic devices used in digital circuits, functioning as a form of temporary storage. They are capable of holding one bit of information and maintaining that state until it is changed by an external signal. Latches operate on the principle of feedback, where the output is looped back to the input to maintain the state. They are used in various applications for storing data, creating delay circuits, and stabilizing volatile signals. There are different types of latches, such as the D-latch and the SR-latch, each with its specific operational characteristics and uses.",

          "text": "The main difference between latches and flip-flops lies in their operating mechanisms and how they handle data: Latches: These are level-triggered devices, meaning they are sensitive to the input signals as long as they are active (high or low). A latch can change its output state as long as the control signal (like a clock) is in a particular state. Flip-Flops: These are edge-triggered devices, meaning they change their state only at specific moments, typically on the rising or falling edge of a control signal (like a clock pulse). Flip-flops are more suitable for synchronous circuits where changes occur in alignment with a clock signal.",
