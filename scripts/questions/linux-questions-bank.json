      "title": "Explain the difference between a process and a thread in Linux.",
      "answer": "In Linux, a process is an independent program that has its own memory space, file descriptors, and resources. A thread, on the other hand, is a lightweight execution unit within a process that shares the same memory space and resources as the parent process. Threads are used for concurrent execution within a single process.",
