Cache Invalidation Mechanism: Using a publish-subscribe model for invalidating stale cache entries, ensuring consistency but potentially introducing latency.

Versioning: Attaching version numbers to data items for conflict resolution, adding overhead but aiding in determining the most recent data version.

Time to Live (TTL): Setting expiration times for cache entries to prevent stale data, simple but may not suit strong consistency needs.
