      "title": "What is the OSI model, and why is it important in networking?",
      "answer": "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how network protocols and communication work. It's important because it standardizes networking concepts into seven layers, making it easier to discuss and design networks. The layers are:\nPhysical layer: Responsible for the physical connection between devices.\nData Link layer: Responsible for creating a link between devices and error-free data transfer.\nNetwork layer: Responsible for routing data packets between devices.\nTransport layer: Responsible for the reliable delivery of data between devices.\nSession layer: Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between devices.\nPresentation layer: Responsible for formatting and converting data for use by the application layer.\nApplication layer: Responsible for providing an interface for applications to access the network.",

      "answer": "Bus: In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus. Data is transmitted along the bus and all devices receive it, but only the device for which the data is intended processes it.\nStar: In a star topology, each device is connected to a central hub or switch. Data is transmitted from the source device to the hub, which then forwards it to the intended destination device.\nRing: In a ring topology, each device is connected to two other devices, creating a circular network. Data is transmitted around the ring in one direction and passes through each device until it reaches its destination.\nMesh: In a mesh topology, each device has a direct connection to every other device in the network. This allows multiple paths for data to travel, making the network more robust and resistant to failure.\nTree: In a tree topology, the network is connected in a hierarchical manner, with a root node connected to one or more intermediary nodes, which are in turn connected to leaf nodes.\nHybrid: It's a combination of two or more topologies",

The data is transmitted in the order it was generated and it is guaranteed to be delivered in that order. E.g. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\nDatagrams: A datagram is a self-contained packet of data that is transmitted between devices. Each datagram contains its own header information, which includes the destination address, and is treated as a separate unit of data. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) uses a datagram-based approach to data transfer, where data is divided into packets, each of which is sent independently to the receiver. There is no guarantee that the packets will be delivered in the order they were sent, and it's up to the application to handle any out-of-order packets.",

      "answer": "Parity: A parity bit is added to each data unit (byte, word, etc.) to ensure that the number of 1's in the unit is even or odd. If an error occurs, the parity bit will no longer match the data unit, indicating that an error has occurred.\nChecksum: A checksum is a value calculated from the data in the packet. The sender and receiver both calculate the checksum of the packet, and if the values do not match, an error is assumed to have occurred.\nCyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): A more robust error detection method than parity and checksum. A polynomial division is performed on the data unit with a pre-agreed upon divisor and the remainder is appended to the data unit to form the code word. The receiver performs the same polynomial division and if the remainder is not zero, an error is assumed to have occurred.",
