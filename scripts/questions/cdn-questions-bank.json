      "title": "What is a CDN?",
      "answer": "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that delivers web content, such as web pages, videos, images, and other types of web assets, to users based on their geographic location, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.\nThe primary goal of a CDN is to improve access to web content by reducing latency, which is the time taken for a web page or file to be delivered to a user's device.",

      "title": "Briefly explain how a CDN works.",
      "answer": "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) enhances the speed and efficiency of content delivery over the internet. It works by:\nDistributing Servers Globally: Placing multiple servers at different geographic locations.\nRedirecting User Requests: When a user requests content (like a web page or image), the request is redirected to the nearest server.\nDelivering Cached Content: The closest server responds with the cached content, reducing the data delivery time.\nFetching and Storing New Content: If the content isn't on the nearest server, it's retrieved from the origin server and cached for future requests.",

      "title": "How does caching work in a CDN.",
      "answer": "Initial Content Fetch: Content is initially retrieved from the origin server upon the first request.\nCaching on Edge Servers: This content is cached on CDN's edge servers, located closer to users.\nServing Cached Content: Subsequent user requests are fulfilled from the nearest edge server's cache, reducing load times.\nTime-to-Live (TTL): Cached content has a set TTL, determining how long it's stored before being refreshed from the origin server.\nCache Invalidation: Content can be manually removed or updated in the cache as needed.\nOptimization: The CDN may optimize content for faster delivery, like compressing files.",

      "id": 7,
      "level": "Mid",
      "title": "What does TTL mean?",
      "answer": "TTL, or \"Time to Live,\" is a setting that determines how long a piece of information remains valid or stored. In networking, it refers to the lifespan of data packets, decreasing with each hop in the network until they are discarded. In DNS systems, it dictates how long DNS records are cached before a fresh query is made.\nIn caching systems, like CDNs, it specifies how long content stays in the cache before being refreshed or removed. Essentially, TTL helps balance data freshness with resource usage.",

      "title": "What does cache hit ratio mean?",
      "answer": "Cache hit ratio in computing refers to the percentage of requested data that is served from the cache, rather than directly from the original data source. It's a measure of the effectiveness of the cache system.\nHigher ratios indicate more efficient caching, leading to faster data retrieval and reduced load on the primary data source.",

      "level": "Mid",
      "title": "What is cache invalidation?",
      "answer": "Cache invalidation is the process of removing or marking as outdated the cached data. This is necessary when the original data has changed, ensuring that users don't receive stale or incorrect information. Invalidation can be challenging in distributed systems, as it must ensure that all cache locations are updated or cleared simultaneously.",

      "title": "How does a CDN distribute content across different geographic locations?",
      "answer": "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) distributes content across different geographic locations using the following steps:\nGlobal Network of Servers: CDNs have servers in various data centers worldwide, storing cached content.\nContent Replication: Content is replicated across these servers, including web pages, images, and videos.\nDNS Resolution: When a user requests content, the CDN uses DNS to identify their location.\nRouting to Nearest Server: The user's request is directed to the closest server (in terms of network latency) that has the requested content.\nLoad Balancing: CDNs distribute user requests across multiple servers to prevent overload.\nHandling Dynamic and Static Content: CDNs efficiently deliver both static (like images) and dynamic (like user-specific pages) content.\nContent Updating and Cache Management: CDNs update cached content when the original content changes, prioritizing frequently accessed content.\nReduced Latency: Serving content from a nearby server reduces latency and speeds up content delivery.\nScalability and Reliability: CDNs can manage traffic spikes and maintain high availability by rerouting requests if needed.\nSecurity: CDNs enhance security by distributing load and mitigating attacks like DDoS.",

      "level": "Senior",
      "title": "How does DNS play a role in CDN functionality?",
      "answer": "DNS (Domain Name System) plays a key role in CDN (Content Delivery Network) functionality by directing user requests to the optimal server, thus enhancing content delivery:\nDomain Name Resolution: When a user accesses a website, the browser contacts a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address.\nCDN Integration: Websites using a CDN have their DNS configurations point to the CDN's DNS servers.\nGeolocation and Server Selection: The CDN's DNS server determines the user's location and selects the nearest or most suitable edge server in the CDN network.\nRouting User Requests: The CDN DNS responds with the IP address of the chosen edge server, ensuring the user connects to the optimal server location.\nLoad Balancing: The CDN DNS considers server load and health to evenly distribute traffic and prevent overloading.\nImproved Performance: By routing users to the closest or best-performing server, DNS reduces latency and speeds up content delivery.\nHandling Traffic Spikes and Failover: The CDN can redistribute traffic during high traffic times and reroute requests in case of server outages, ensuring continuous availability.",
