Distributed Development: Each user has a full copy of the project, including its history, allowing for work even when offline. Backup and Restore: Changes are stored securely, providing a backup. You can easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. Staging Area: Allows you to review and organize commits before pushing them, ensuring only intended changes are added. Flexibility: Supports various workflows (centralized, feature branch, Gitflow, etc.), making it adaptable to different project needs. Open Source: Free to use and has a large community, providing extensive resources and support.
