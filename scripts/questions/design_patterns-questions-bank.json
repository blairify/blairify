They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure does not need to change. These patterns focus on simplifying the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. Examples: Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves a wrapper that converts one interface to another. Bridge Pattern: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. Decorator Pattern: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically, without altering its structure. This is achieved by creating a decorator class that wraps the original class. Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, thereby reducing the learning curve and minimizing dependencies on external code. Flyweight Pattern: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects. Proxy Pattern: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it, either for delaying its instantiation, improving performance, or adding security layers.",

They help in managing complex interactions and facilitate flexible and maintainable software design. Key Behavioral Patterns Include: Observer: Manages one-to-many dependencies between objects, automatically updating dependents when one object changes. Strategy: Enables the selection of an algorithm at runtime, making algorithms interchangeable. Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing operations to be parameterized, queued, and logged. State: Allows objects to change behavior when their internal state changes, seemingly changing their class. Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm. Iterator: Provides a way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure. Mediator: Encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly. Memento: Allows an object's state to be saved and restored, enabling undo or rollback capabilities.",
