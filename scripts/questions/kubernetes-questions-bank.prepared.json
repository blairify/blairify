It communicates with the Master Node and ensures that containers are running in pods as specified in the cluster's desired state. It manages container lifecycle operations, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring containers. Container Runtime: The Container Runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, or CRI-O) is responsible for actually running containers and managing their execution. It takes container specifications provided by the Kubelet and runs the containers accordingly. Kube Proxy: Kube Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each Worker Node. It maintains network rules on the node to enable communication between pods and services within the cluster. It helps in load balancing traffic to the appropriate pods. Pod: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Each Worker Node can run one or more pods, and each pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace. Containers within the same pod can communicate with each other using localhost, making it easier to manage related processes. CNI (Container Network Interface): CNI plugins are responsible for setting up the network connectivity for pods on the Worker Node. They ensure that pods can communicate with each other and with the external network as needed. Container Storage Interface (CSI): This component allows Kubernetes pods to interact with external storage systems, providing a way to mount storage volumes into containers when required.",
