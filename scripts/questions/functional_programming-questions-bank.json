      "title": "What is functional programming, and how does it differ from imperative programming?",
      "answer": "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It differs from imperative programming in that it avoids changing state and mutable data, emphasizing immutability and pure functions.",

      "id": 2,
      "level": "Junior",
      "title": "What are pure functions, and why are they important in functional programming?",
      "answer": "Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They are important in functional programming because they make code more predictable, testable, and parallelizable.\nExample in Haskell:\n\ntypescript\n\nCopy code\n\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int\nadd x y = x + y\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  let result = add 3 5\n  putStrLn (\"The result is: \" ++ show result)\nIn this example, we call the add function with the arguments 3 and 5, and it returns 8. The code is predictable, and the function is pure, making it easy to reason about and test.",

      "title": "Explain the concept of immutability in functional programming.",
      "answer": "Immutability means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead, any modification creates a new data structure. Immutability ensures that data remains unchanged, simplifying reasoning about code.",

      "title": "What is a higher-order function, and can you provide an example of one?",
      "answer": "A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. An example is the map function in Python or JavaScript, which takes a function and a list and applies the function to each element of the list, returning a new list.\n\ntypescript\n\nCopy code\n\n# Define a function to square a number\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Use the map function to square each number in the list\nsquared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n\n# Convert the result back to a list (map returns an iterable)\nsquared_numbers_list = list(squared_numbers)\n\n# Print the original and squared numbersprint(\"Original numbers:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Squared numbers:\", squared_numbers_list)",

      "title": "Explain the concept of closures in functional programming.",
      "answer": "A closure is a function that \"closes over\" its lexical scope, capturing variables from the surrounding environment. Closures allow functions to maintain state across multiple calls, often used in functional programming for encapsulation.\n\ntypescript\n\nCopy code\n\n-- Create a function that takes an argument 'x'\nmakeIncrementer :: Int -> (Int -> Int)\nmakeIncrementer x = \\y -> x + y\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    let add5 = makeIncrementer 5 -- create a closure\n    putStrLn \"Result of adding 5 to 7:\"\n    print (add5 7) -- The 'add5' function captures 'x' from the lexical scope",

      "title": "What is lazy evaluation, and how does it relate to functional programming?",
      "answer": "Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy where expressions are only evaluated when their values are actually needed. It's related to functional programming because it allows for more efficient and expressive code by avoiding unnecessary computations.",

      "title": "What is currying, and how can it be used in functional programming?",
      "answer": "Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

      "title": "What is function composition, and why is it important in functional programming?",
      "answer": "Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. It's important in functional programming because it allows you to build complex operations from simpler, composable functions.\nExample in Haskell:\n\ntypescript\n\nCopy code\n\n-- Define two functions\naddTwo :: Int -> Int\naddTwo x = x + 2\n\nsquare :: Int -> Int\nsquare x = x * x\n\n-- Compose the two functions to create a new function\naddTwoAndSquare :: Int -> Int\naddTwoAndSquare = square . addTwo\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  putStrLn \"Result of composing addTwo and square for 5:\"\n  print (addTwoAndSquare 5) -- Composed function",

      "title": "What is tail recursion, and why is it important in functional programming?",
      "answer": "Tail recursion is a form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in a function. It's important because it allows the compiler or interpreter to optimize the recursion, preventing stack overflow errors and making recursive algorithms more efficient.",

      "title": "What is the map function, and how is it used in functional programming?",
      "answer": "The map function is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a collection (e.g., a list) and returns a new collection containing the results. It's a fundamental operation in functional programming for transforming data.",
