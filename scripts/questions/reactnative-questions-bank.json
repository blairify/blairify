      "title": "What is React Native, and how does it differ from React?",
      "answer": "React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write components that can be compiled to native code for iOS and Android platforms. React, on the other hand, is a library for building web user interfaces.
