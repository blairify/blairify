      "title": "What is Docker?",
      "answer": "Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.\nThis ensures that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.",

      "answer": "A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). It allows multiple VMs, each with their own operating system, to share a single physical host's hardware resources.\nThere are two types:\nType 1 (bare-metal): runs directly on the host's hardware.\nType 2 (hosted): runs on a conventional operating system.\nHypervisors are essential in virtualization, enabling efficient resource utilization and isolation between different VMs.",

When a file or directory from an image layer is changed, it's copied (written) to the container's writable layer, leaving the original image layer unchanged.\nThis approach optimizes storage space and resource usage, as multiple containers can share the same base image without duplicating data, only diverging when changes occur.",

They're completely managed and isolated from the host filesystem.\nBind mounts, on the other hand, can be stored anywhere on the host system. They might be used for sensitive files like system libraries or configuration files. They directly reflect the filesystem of the host, meaning changes to a bind mount are immediately reflected on the host, and vice versa.",
