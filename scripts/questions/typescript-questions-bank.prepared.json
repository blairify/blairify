          "text": "Strong Typing: TypeScript's ability to explicitly define variable types improves code quality and reliability. It reduces the likelihood of runtime errors by catching type-related issues during development. Code Clarity and Maintainability: By enforcing type definitions, TypeScript makes the code more readable and easier to understand, which is particularly beneficial in large codebases or team environments. Object-Oriented Features: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, and inheritance, making it easier to organize and manage code. Improved Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript's strong typing allows for better tooling support, including more powerful autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities. Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript. This makes it easy to adopt incrementally and use with existing JavaScript codebases. Early Error Detection: TypeScript's compiler can detect errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, leading to more robust code and faster debugging.",

Type Checking Rules: TypeScript offers a set of type checking options that can be configured in tsconfig.json.

They describe the shape of an object or class. Type Alias: Type aliases are defined using the type keyword. They can represent any type, not just objects, and are more flexible. Extending/Implementing: Interface: Interfaces can be extended by other interfaces using the extends keyword, and classes can implement interfaces. Type Alias: Type aliases cannot be extended or implemented. They are standalone and represent specific types. Compatibility: Interface: Interfaces are open-ended by default. If you declare an interface with a certain structure, you can later add more properties to it without causing issues. Type Alias: Type aliases create exact types. Once defined, you cannot add or change properties to the type without breaking compatibility. Union and Intersection: Interface: Interfaces are not suitable for creating union or intersection types directly. Type Alias: Type aliases can be used to create union types (|) and intersection types (&) more easily. Example: // Interface interface Person { name: string; age: number; } // Extending an interface interface Employee extends Person { employeeId: string; } // Type alias type Person = { name: string; age: number; }; // Creating a union type with a type alias type StringOrNumber = string | number;",

The compilation process involves several steps: Type Checking: The TypeScript compiler checks the TypeScript code for type errors and performs type inference to determine variable types. Emitting JavaScript: After successful type checking, the compiler generates equivalent JavaScript code. The generated code adheres to the specified ECMAScript version (e.g., ES5, ES6). Output Files: The compiled JavaScript code can be output to one or more JavaScript files, preserving the directory structure of the source code. Declaration Files (Optional): Declaration files (with a .d.ts extension) can also be generated to provide type information for TypeScript consumers of JavaScript libraries. Module Resolution: If the code uses modules, the compiler resolves module dependencies and ensures that imported modules are available. Source Maps (Optional): Optionally, source maps can be generated to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript source code for debugging. To compile TypeScript code, you typically run the tsc command with the TypeScript source files as arguments.",

Example: type Shape = { kind: 'circle'; radius: number; } | { kind: 'rectangle'; width: number; height: number; }; function getArea(shape: Shape): number { switch (shape.kind) { case 'circle': return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2; case 'rectangle': return shape.width * shape.height; default: // TypeScript ensures all cases are handled const exhaustiveCheck: never = shape; return exhaustiveCheck; } } In this example, the Shape type is a discriminated union consisting of two variants: circle and rectangle. The kind property serves as the discriminant. The getArea function uses a switch statement to determine the specific type within the union based on the kind property and calculates the area accordingly.",
