Spans stitch together into a complete trace showing the exact path—and duration—of operations across microservices (e.g., Service A → Service B → Database C). By visualizing where time is spent or where failures occur, it exposes bottlenecks and error points that siloed logs or metrics can’t reveal alone. In essence, distributed tracing turns scattered service logs into a coherent end‑to‑end view of every request, making it indispensable for diagnosing latency and errors in complex, distributed architectures.",
