      "title": "Explain the differences between the Realtime Database and Firestore in Firebase.",
      "answer": "The Realtime Database is a NoSQL, JSON-based database that stores data in a single large JSON tree. Firestore, on the other hand, is a more scalable, multi-region database that organizes data into collections and documents. Firestore supports more complex querying and is generally recommended for new projects due to its flexibility and scalability.",

      "title": "Describe a Firebase project you've worked on, and the challenges you faced.",
      "answer": "Example Project Description: I was part of a team that developed a real-time collaborative note-taking application, similar to Google Docs, using Firebase as the backend for data storage and synchronization. The app allowed multiple users to create, edit, and share notes in real-time.\nChallenges Faced:\nReal-Time Data Synchronization: The primary challenge was implementing real-time data synchronization among multiple users. When one user made changes to a note, it had to be immediately reflected on the screens of all other users collaborating on the same note. This required implementing Firebase Realtime Database effectively.Solution: We leveraged Firebase's real-time synchronization features, especially the built-in event listeners, to instantly update the content across all connected clients. Additionally, we used Firebase security rules to ensure data integrity and access control.\nConcurrency Control and Conflict Resolution: With multiple users simultaneously editing the same note, conflicts and synchronization issues could occur. For instance, if two users edited the same section of a note simultaneously, the app needed a strategy to resolve these conflicts without data loss.Solution: We implemented custom conflict resolution logic that determined which user's changes took precedence in the event of conflicts. We used Firebase's transaction capabilities to atomically update the data while maintaining consistency.\nData Security and Access Control: Ensuring that users could only access and edit the notes they were authorized to was crucial. We needed to enforce stringent security rules to prevent unauthorized access to notes.Solution: We defined complex Firebase security rules that took into account user roles and access permissions. These rules ensured that only the appropriate users had read and write access to specific notes. We implemented user authentication and user roles for fine-grained access control.\nScalability: As the application gained more users, we encountered performance and scalability challenges. Ensuring that the app continued to perform well under increasing loads was a priority.Solution: We optimized the database structure and query patterns to enhance performance. We also used Firebase's scalability features, such as sharding and distributed data storage, to ensure the app could handle increasing user numbers.\nOffline Access: Providing offline access to notes was essential. We needed to ensure that users could continue working on their notes even without an internet connection.Solution: We used Firebase's offline capabilities, allowing the app to store a local cache of data. When users were offline, they could create, edit, and delete notes, and the changes would be automatically synchronized when they regained connectivity.\nIn the end, the project was a success, and the collaborative note-taking app became a valuable tool for users who needed to work together on documents in real-time. Addressing these challenges with Firebase as the backend played a critical role in the project's success.",

      "id": 11,
      "level": "Mid",
      "title": "How does Firebase handle data synchronization and conflicts in a multi-user environment?",
      "answer": "Firebase uses a real-time synchronization approach, and conflicts are typically resolved based on \"last write wins.\" If two users try to update the same data simultaneously, Firebase will choose the latest write as the winning update. To handle conflicts more intelligently, you can implement custom logic in your code, such as using transaction operations in the Realtime Database or Firestore.",
