If the lock is available, the node acquires it, preventing other nodes from making conflicting changes. Performing Operations: With the lock acquired, the node can safely perform its operations on the shared resource.

It guarantees that every read reflects the most recent write. Achieving linearizability in NoSQL databases involves balancing data consistency with system performance and availability, often leading to trade-offs as per the CAP theorem.",
