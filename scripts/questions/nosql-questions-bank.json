      "answer": "Linearizability in distributed systems is a consistency model ensuring that operations (like reads and writes) on a NoSQL database appear instantaneous and in a specific sequence. It guarantees that every read reflects the most recent write.\nAchieving linearizability in NoSQL databases involves balancing data consistency with system performance and availability, often leading to trade-offs as per the CAP theorem.",
