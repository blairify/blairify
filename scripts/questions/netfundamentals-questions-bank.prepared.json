It also involves hiding the internal implementation details of an object and controlling access to its data. Abstraction: Abstraction is the principle of showing only the essential or relevant information to the user while hiding the complex underlying details. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves it, often using abstract classes and interfaces. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and helps in establishing hierarchical relationships between classes.C# supports single inheritance for classes but multiple inheritance for interfaces. Polymorphism: Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.",
