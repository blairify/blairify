It's suitable for scenarios where you need scalable and cost-effective storage for large volumes of data. Azure File Storage: File Storage provides SMB file shares that can be accessed by multiple virtual machines. It's ideal for shared storage in Windows environments and application data that needs file-based access. Azure Disk Storage: Disk Storage is used for attaching persistent disks to virtual machines. It's best for scenarios where you need high-performance block storage, such as running databases.",
