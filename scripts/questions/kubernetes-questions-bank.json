      "title": "Explain the Worker Node in Kubernetes.",
      "answer": "In Kubernetes, a Worker Node is responsible for running containers and executing the workloads assigned to it by the Master Node. Key components:\nKubelet: The Kubelet is an agent running on each Worker Node. It communicates with the Master Node and ensures that containers are running in pods as specified in the cluster's desired state. It manages container lifecycle operations, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring containers.\nContainer Runtime: The Container Runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, or CRI-O) is responsible for actually running containers and managing their execution. It takes container specifications provided by the Kubelet and runs the containers accordingly.\nKube Proxy: Kube Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each Worker Node. It maintains network rules on the node to enable communication between pods and services within the cluster. It helps in load balancing traffic to the appropriate pods.\nPod: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Each Worker Node can run one or more pods, and each pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace. Containers within the same pod can communicate with each other using localhost, making it easier to manage related processes.\nCNI (Container Network Interface): CNI plugins are responsible for setting up the network connectivity for pods on the Worker Node. They ensure that pods can communicate with each other and with the external network as needed.\nContainer Storage Interface (CSI): This component allows Kubernetes pods to interact with external storage systems, providing a way to mount storage volumes into containers when required.",

      "title": "What is a Pod in Kubernetes, and why is it the smallest deployable unit?",
      "answer": "A Pod in Kubernetes is the smallest and simplest deployable unit that can be created and managed. It represents a single instance of an application and can contain one or more containers (such as Docker containers).\nThe reason it's considered the smallest unit is that it encapsulates the application's container(s), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.\nPods are designed to be ephemeral and disposable, which aligns with the Kubernetes model of handling instances of applications.\nEach pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application; when it needs to scale, Kubernetes creates more pods, rather than using single containers as the unit of scaling.",

      "title": "Explain the concept of Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes.",
      "answer": "Persistent Volumes (PVs) in Kubernetes are storage resources in a cluster, used to manage durable storage that persists beyond the lifecycle of individual pods. Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are requests for storage by users, specifying size, and access modes.\nPVCs are matched with appropriate PVs in the cluster, decoupling the specifics of storage provisioning from its use by pods, allowing consistent storage access regardless of the underlying storage infrastructure.",

      "title": "What is a Kubernetes StatefulSet, and in what scenarios would you use it?",
      "answer": "A Kubernetes StatefulSet is a workload API object used for managing stateful applications. It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.\nUnlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. It's used in scenarios where you need stable, unique network identifiers, stable, persistent storage, and ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. This makes it suitable for applications like databases, clustered applications, and any other application that requires stable state or unique identity.",
