      "title": "What are HTML tags?",
      "answer": "HTML tags are the coding elements used to structure and format content on a web page. Each tag is enclosed in angle brackets, like <tagname>, and usually comes in pairs: an opening tag (<tagname>) and a closing tag (</tagname>). Tags can contain attributes for additional functionality.\nExmaple:\n\nhtml\n\nCopy code\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Click here</a>\nThis tag creates a hyperlink; <a> is the tag, href=\"https://example.com\" is the attribute, and \"Click here\" is the link text displayed to the user.",

      "title": "What are attributes and how do you use them?",
      "answer": "Attributes in HTML are used to provide additional information about elements. They are written as name-value pairs within the opening tag of an element, like attribute_name=\"attribute_value\".\nFor example, in <a href=\"https://www.example.com\">, href is an attribute specifying the link's URL. Attributes are used for various purposes, such as linking resources, assigning styles, and identifying elements for scripts and CSS. Some attributes, like checked in input tags, are boolean and don't require a value.",

      "answer": "CORS stands for \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.\" It is a security feature that manages how web resources (like fonts, JavaScript, etc.) are requested from different domains. CORS addresses the issue of web browsers' same-origin policy, which restricts how a document or script from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.\nThis policy is in place to prevent malicious attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). CORS provides a way for web servers to declare which origins are permitted to access resources on the server, allowing safe cross-origin requests and data sharing.",

      "answer": "In web browser rendering, layout, painting, and compositing are distinct stages:\n\nLayout: This stage involves calculating the position and size of each element on the web page. It's also known as \"reflow.\" The browser examines the DOM and CSSOM to understand the document structure and style rules, then determines the geometry of each element.\nPainting: Once the layout is determined, the painting process begins. This involves filling in the pixels for each element. It includes drawing text, colors, images, borders, and shadows. This process converts each element into layers that can be visually rendered.\nCompositing: In the final stage, the layers created during the painting process are assembled into the final visual representation on the screen. This is where the browser decides the order of layer stacking and how they overlap, applying any final touches like CSS transitions or animations.",

      "answer": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) are both languages used to write web pages, but they have key differences:\nSyntax Rules: XHTML is more strict in terms of syntax. It requires all elements to be properly nested, closed, and in lowercase, and attributes must be quoted and use a full declaration (<!DOCTYPE ...>).\nXML-based: XHTML is an application of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), meaning it needs to be well-formed XML, while HTML is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and is more lenient with syntax.\nError Handling: Browsers tend to be more forgiving with HTML errors, while XHTML errors can cause a page to fail to render properly.\nMIME Type: XHTML is served with an XML MIME type (application/xhtml+xml), which enforces strict error handling, whereas HTML is served with a text MIME type (text/html).\nDocument Object Model (DOM): While both create a DOM, the XML DOM of XHTML is slightly different and can have implications for JavaScript interaction.",

Web Storage is more secure and can store a larger amount of data.\nThere are two main mechanisms:\nLocal Storage: Stores data with no expiration date. The data will persist even after the browser window is closed. It's ideal for storing data that should be kept across sessions, like user preferences or application state.\nSession Storage: Stores data for one session and is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
