This process converts each element into layers that can be visually rendered. Compositing: In the final stage, the layers created during the painting process are assembled into the final visual representation on the screen.

Web Storage is more secure and can store a larger amount of data. There are two main mechanisms: Local Storage: Stores data with no expiration date. The data will persist even after the browser window is closed. It's ideal for storing data that should be kept across sessions, like user preferences or application state. Session Storage: Stores data for one session and is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed. Useful for data relevant to a single page session, like form inputs on a single page.",
