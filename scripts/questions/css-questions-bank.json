      "title": "Does margin-top or margin-bottom have an effect on inline elements?",
      "answer": "No, margin-top and margin-bottom do not affect inline elements in CSS. Inline elements respect margin-left and margin-right, but not vertical margins (margin-top and margin-bottom).\nThis is due to the nature of inline elements, which flow within the text and don't disrupt the vertical line flow. For vertical spacing on inline elements, other methods such as line-height or padding might be used, or changing the element's display type.",

      "level": "Mid",
      "title": "Explain the order in which styles are applied in CSS.",
      "answer": "The order in which styles are applied in CSS is determined by a combination of three main factors: specificity, source order, and inheritance.\nSpecificity: This is the primary factor. Specificity is a measure of how precisely a CSS selector matches a set of elements. Selectors with higher specificity override those with lower specificity.\nSource Order: When two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS code takes precedence. This is known as the source order rule. It means that if you have two equally specific rules, the second one will override the first one.\nInheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements, unless overridden. For example, font and color properties are often inherited. This means that if you set a property on a parent element, it can affect the child elements unless they have their own specific rules.\nImportance: The !important declaration in CSS can override the specificity and source order. When !important is used on a CSS property, it becomes the most important and overrides other properties, regardless of their specificity or source order.",

      "title": "What are the three main methods of integrating CSS on a web page?",
      "answer": "Inline CSS: Directly applying styles to HTML elements using the style attribute in each tag. Example: <p style=\"color: blue;\">.\nInternal or Embedded CSS: Placing CSS within a <style> tag in the HTML document's <head> section. This method styles elements on that specific page only.\nExternal CSS: Linking to an external CSS file using the <link> tag in the HTML's <head>. This method promotes reusability and separation of content and style, as one CSS file can style multiple HTML pages.",

      "answer": "DOM reflow occurs when there are changes to the layout of a web page, causing the browser to recalculate element positions and geometries. This can happen due to:\n\nAdding, Removing, or Updating DOM Elements: Changes to the document structure.\nModifying CSS Styles: Changes in styling that affect layout.\nManipulating the Browser Window: Resizing the window, scrolling, or changing orientation.\nQuerying Layout Properties: Accessing certain properties like offsetWidth or scrollTop.",

      "answer": "Modular CSS: Breaking CSS into smaller, reusable modules, often aligning with components.\nComponent-Based Architecture: Using methodologies like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) to structure CSS around UI components.\nPreprocessors (SASS, LESS): Utilizing features like variables, mixins, and nesting for better organization and maintainability.\nCSS Frameworks: Implementing frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a consistent and structured approach.\nCSS-in-JS: For projects using JavaScript frameworks, embedding CSS directly within JavaScript files.\nUtility-First CSS: Adopting utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS for a more functional approach.\nDocumentation and Style Guides: Maintaining clear documentation and style guides to ensure consistency and clarity.\nFile Organization: Structuring files logically, often mirroring the structure of the project's components.",

      "title": "How does CSS work under the hood?",
      "answer": "Loading: The browser loads the CSS from external files, embedded style tags, or inline styles.\nParsing: CSS is parsed into understandable rulesets. The parser resolves the selectors and properties.\nConversion to Stylesheets: Parsed data is converted into stylesheets understood by the browser.\nProcessing Rules: The browser matches selectors to corresponding nodes in the DOM (Document Object Model).\nCascade and Inheritance: Rules are applied following the cascade and inheritance principles, with conflicts resolved by specificity and source order.\nStyle Computation: The final values of CSS properties for each element are computed.\nLayout/Reflow: The browser calculates the position and size of each element.\nPainting: The visual representation of the page is created based on the layout.\nCompositing: Layers are combined and rendered on the screen.",

      "title": "What are functions/mixins?",
      "answer": "In the context of CSS pre-processors like SASS or LESS, functions and mixins are powerful features used for writing reusable and dynamic CSS code:\nFunctions: Functions compute and return a value. They can take arguments and are used for calculations, color manipulations, and other operations that return a value. For example, a function might calculate a contrasting color or a responsive font size.\nMixins: Mixins are blocks of reusable code that can be included in other CSS rules. They accept arguments and can be used to embed entire groups of CSS declarations into a rule. Mixins are ideal for vendor prefixing, grid layouts, font stacks, etc., allowing for more maintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.",

      "answer": "When a browser determines which elements match a CSS selector, it follows these steps:\n\nParsing CSS: The browser parses the CSS file, understanding the selectors and their corresponding styles.\nBuilding the DOM: It constructs the Document Object Model (DOM) from the HTML, representing the page structure.\nSelector Matching: The browser matches CSS selectors against the elements in the DOM. This process is done right-to-left; it first checks the key selector (the rightmost part), then moves leftwards in the rule.\nApplying Styles: Once an element is matched, the browser applies the corresponding CSS styles. If multiple rules match, it uses the cascade rules (specificity and source order) to determine which styles to apply.\nRendering: The final step is rendering the page with the applied styles.",
