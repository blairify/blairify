Specificity: This is the primary factor. Specificity is a measure of how precisely a CSS selector matches a set of elements. Selectors with higher specificity override those with lower specificity. Source Order: When two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS code takes precedence. This is known as the source order rule. It means that if you have two equally specific rules, the second one will override the first one. Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements, unless overridden. For example, font and color properties are often inherited. This means that if you set a property on a parent element, it can affect the child elements unless they have their own specific rules. Importance: The !important declaration in CSS can override the specificity and source order. When !important is used on a CSS property, it becomes the most important and overrides other properties, regardless of their specificity or source order.",

Grid Items: The direct children of the grid container, which can be positioned and aligned within the grid. Rows and Columns: The grid is divided into rows and columns, which can be explicitly defined or implicitly created based on the content. Grid Lines: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be used to place items and define areas. Grid Cells, Areas, and Gaps: Individual spaces formed by the grid (cells), larger areas spanning multiple cells, and the spacing between rows and columns (gaps). Responsiveness: The grid layout can be made responsive using media queries, fractional units, and repeat functions, allowing for flexible and adaptive web designs.",

They can take arguments and are used for calculations, color manipulations, and other operations that return a value. For example, a function might calculate a contrasting color or a responsive font size. Mixins: Mixins are blocks of reusable code that can be included in other CSS rules. They accept arguments and can be used to embed entire groups of CSS declarations into a rule. Mixins are ideal for vendor prefixing, grid layouts, font stacks, etc., allowing for more maintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.",

Building the DOM: It constructs the Document Object Model (DOM) from the HTML, representing the page structure. Selector Matching: The browser matches CSS selectors against the elements in the DOM. This process is done right-to-left; it first checks the key selector (the rightmost part), then moves leftwards in the rule. Applying Styles: Once an element is matched, the browser applies the corresponding CSS styles. If multiple rules match, it uses the cascade rules (specificity and source order) to determine which styles to apply. Rendering: The final step is rendering the page with the applied styles.",
